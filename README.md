# JediTraining

Code for the [Jedi Training challenge posted on DEV](https://dev.to/devteam/jedi-training-challenge-5a48) as part of the May the 4th (Star Wars day) celebrations.

Check out the code, and feel free to use it!

## Challenge

The instructions from the DEV challenge are as follows:

Write a program that generates a sequence of 10 random numbers between 1 and 10.
Use the Force (code) to apply the following transformations to the sequence:

- Multiply every even number by 2
- Add 5 to every odd number
- Replace any number greater than 10 with 1
- Print the final sequence to the console.

## Run my code

See if my code works (I hope it does!). May the force be with you!

Thanks to [rainleander](https://github.com/rainleander/may-the-fourth/blob/main/README.md) for the idea of adding this section, and for the instructions on how to do it!.

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mishmanners/JediTraining.git
```

2. Change directory to the cloned repository:

```
cd Jedi-Training
```

3. Run the script using Python:

```
python JediMindTricks.py
```

4. The script will output the final transformed sequence of numbers (hopefully :fingers_crossed:)
